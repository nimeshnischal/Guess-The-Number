# Guess-The-Number
A command window based game developed in **python**.
The user sets the **difficulty level** he/she wants to play in.
Then they input a number within a given **range**.
The computer helps the user in guessing the correct number by showing **messages** (hints).
On completion of a game, the user can **play again** with a new difficulty level and a new 
generated number.

### Uses **nimesh_app_basics module**
The module nimesh_app_basics is a custom module made by me to help me in the development of
basic commad window based apps.
